\usage{
f_local_search(level_of_significance, dfreedom1, dfreedom2,
tol, max_iteration, li, ui, is_echo)
}
\arguments{
\item{level_of_significance}{a value between 0 and 1}

\item{dfreedom1}{degree of freedom for the first kind}

\item{dfreedom2}{degree of freedom for the second kind}

\item{tol}{tolerance quantity}

\item{max_iteration}{the desired number of iteration}

\item{li}{the lower bound of the search space, by default, it's set to 0}

\item{ui}{the upper bound of the search space, by default, it's set to 50}

\item{is_echo}{a boolean parameter, by default, it's FALSE}
}
\value{
a numeric value or an iteration table

\description{
\code{f_local_search} is used to find the critical value of the
f statistics for given any level of significance between 0 and 1
}
\details{
\code{f_local_search} function is used to find the
critical value of the f statistics for given any level of
significance between 0 and 1. This critical value is used to
construct the 95\% confidence interval for certain parameters,
and this critical value is used in hypothesis testing as wells.
\code{f_local_searc} function contain 8 parameters with the
following details, 3 parameters, which by defaults, already
contain a value, and 5 parameters are not.

\code{level_of_significance} is a value between 0 and 1, and it's
corresponds to confidence value, if confidence limits is known,
then the level of significance can be obtained by subtracting
confidence limits from 1. \code{dfreedom1} is the degree of
freedom of the first kind, similarly for \code{dfreedom2}. For
example, in the hypothesis testing concerning either certain
parameters in the multiple linear regression model is significant
or not,the analysis of variances (anova) is conducted in order to
obtain f statistics with degree of freedom 1 and n-k-1. \code{tol}
is the tolerance quantity, usually 0.001, meaning, \code{f_local_search}
function will return the critical value of the f statistics correct
up to 3-decimal place. \code{is_echo} is the boolean variable,
if \code{is_echo} is FALSE, then \code{f_local_search} will return
numeric value only, and if \code{is_echo} is TRUE, then
\code{f_local_search} will return iteration table.
}
\note{
In order to check wether the critical value obtained from
\code{f_local_search} function is true or not, pf function can
be used
}
\examples{
# Given the level of significance is 0.025, with
# degree of freedom for sample 1 is 21 and
# degree of freedom for sample 2 is 27, then
# the critical value of f statistics is computed
# as follows.
f_local_search(
level_of_significance = 0.025, dfreedom1 = 21,
dfreedom2 = 27, tol = 0.001, max_iteration = 50,
) #[1] 2.236959
pf(2.236959, df1= 21, df2= 27) #[1] 0.9750136
1 - pf(2.236959, df1= 21, df2= 27) #[1] 0.02498644

f_local_search(
level_of_significance = 0.025, dfreedom1 = 21,
dfreedom2 = 27, tol = 0.001, max_iteration = 50,
is_echo = TRUE
) # return an iteration table

If one need the critical value of z for dynamic level of
significance between 0 and 1, then on can use \code{z_local_search}
function. Similarly, for t and chi square statistics.
