Description: Finding statistic value of z, t, chi square, and f without looking
    for a table of the value of z standard normal distribution, or table
    of the value of t distribution with v degrees of freedom, and so chi square and
    f for dynamic level of significance. It is based from oscillation
    strategy from tabu search, binary search, and bisection search algorithm.
